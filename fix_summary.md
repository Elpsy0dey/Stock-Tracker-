# API Issue Fixes for Stock Tracker

## Issues Identified

1. **Model Unavailability**: The original code was trying to use `gpt-3.5-turbo` which isn't available in the free tier of your API service (free.v36.cm). This was causing 503 errors.

2. **No Fallback Logic**: The code didn't have proper fallback logic to try other models when the primary one failed.

3. **Error Handling**: While your code had good error detection, it wasn't attempting to use alternative models when authorization issues occurred.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Changed Default Model
- Updated `config/api_config.py` to use `gpt-4o-mini` as the default model, which our tests showed was working.

### 2. Added Model Fallback System
- Created a list of models to try in order of preference
- Modified the API service to try each model sequentially when others fail
- Improved error detection to identify specific model unavailability (503 errors)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better detection of "Unauthorized request" errors
- Reduced retries per model but increased total attempts across models
- Improved debugging output to show which model is being used

## Test Results

- Performance Analysis: Successfully working with `gpt-4o-mini`
- Trading Suggestions: Working with fallback to the rule-based engine when API models failed

## Recommendations for Future

1. Periodically test available models as the free tier availability may change
2. Consider adding more diagnostic logging to track which models are successful
3. Update the model list if new models become available in the free tier

## Usage Notes

The system now tries models in this order:
1. `gpt-4o-mini` (primary)
2. `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`
3. `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`
4. `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k`

If all fail, it falls back to the built-in rule-based analysis.
